# OS and Mechanics Failures
#### Info here is based off of alpha info.

In Marathon there are two types of repair/reset kits, these are software repair and hardware repair. To repair hardware there is Mechanics Kits and Advanced Mechanics Kits. For software there is OS Reboot and Advanced OS Reboot.

## Mechanics Failures
There are two (?) known types of hardware failures, immobilised and reduced healing. To remove these simply use a hardware reset or advanced hardware reset.

### Toxin
This debuff is gained by walking through a chem nade (other sources of this may happen I do not know at this time). While active the runner takes damage over time.

### Reduced Healing
This debuff is gained by walking through a chem nade (other sources of this may happen I do not know at this time). While active when using a healing item the time for the animation (and by extension activation of the healing) is increased by (some)% (50-100% is my guess).
### Immobilised
Being immobilised reduces your shell's agility stat (? needs fact checking + amount info). This can be gained by being hit by a Destroyer's Prime ability (iirc).


## OS Failures
I know of only one type of software failure at this time. These can be fixed by popping an os reboot.
### EMP
#### Sourced from a Marathon post
![emp-os.png](/assets/emp-os.png) <br />
This debuff is gained from some sort of grenade (emp nade?). In [this post](https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2018766111404441735) around 40s in we see the player get hit with this causing their ability cooldowns to be paused and glitch out with abilities being unable to activate and any active abilities being shut down (This may lock out passives idk).  After finish the runner gains the Ability Regen Paused debuff. 

### Ability Regen Paused
While this debuff is active the runners abilities cooldowns are paused and hidden. (During this time any abilities that were off cooldown before gaining this debuff may be able to be activated, i don't know for sure though )

# Firewall and Hardware
These stats reduce the time to recover from OS and Mechanics failures.
