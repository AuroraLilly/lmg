# OS and Mechanics Failures
#### Info here is based off of alpha info.

In Marathon there are two types of repair/reset kits, these are software repair and hardware repair. To repair hardware there is Mechanics Kits and Advanced Mechanics Kits. For software there is OS Reboot and Advanced OS Reboot.

## Mechanics Failures
There are two (?) known types of hardware failures, immobilised and reduced healing. To remove these simply use a hardware reset or advanced hardware reset.
### Reduced Healing
This debuff is gained by walking through a chem nade (other sources of this may happen I do not know at this time). While active when using a healing item the time for the animation (and by extension activation of the healing) is increased by (some)% (50-100% is my guess).
### Immobilised
Being immobilised reduces your shell's agility stat (? needs fact checking + amount info). This can be gained by being hit by a Destroyer's Prime ability (iirc).


## OS Failures
I know of only one type of software failure at this time. These can be fixed by popping an os reboot.
### EMP
#### Sourced from a Marathon post
![emp-os.png](/assets/emp-os.png)
This debuff is gained from some sort of grenade (emp nade?). In [this post](https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2018766111404441735) around 40s in we see the player get hit with this causing their ability cooldowns to be paused and glitch out, where after 10s it goes into a general os failure with cooldowns not being visible. (This could be either abilities paused, or blocking status of said abilities while increasing cooldown length)

# Firewall and Hardware
These stats reduce the time to recover from OS and Mechanics failures.
