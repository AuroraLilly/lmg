# Healing
As of time of writing as revealed in [this post](https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2018766111404441735) healing now rather than acting instantly ticks up over time. This acts on both shields and health.

## Health Specific Items
Health (or to differentiate "Grey Health") has three items that give the ability to heal the player. These are Minor Patch Kits (Prefix to Patch Kit unknown),  Patch Kits, and Advanced Patch Kits. <br />

### Minor Patch Kits
Heal 10-15% (?) health and take (1-1.5s ?) to use. The true figures are currently unknown.
### Patch Kits
Heal 25-45% (? - needs proper calculation) and take (2.7 - 3 s ~ needs retiming) to use.
### Advanced Patch Kits
Heal 100% (? - may have changed) and take (5-6s ~ unknown) to use.

## Shield Specific Items
As with health items there are three specific shield items. These are Minor Mechanics Kits (Prefix to Mechanics Kit unknown), Mechanics Kits, and Advanced Mechanics Kits. <br />
