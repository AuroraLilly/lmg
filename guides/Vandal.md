# Vandal
## My beloved 💖
The Vandal shell is based around movement and amplifying said movement. As movement techs (and possibly exploits) get discovered they will be tracked here.

## Basic Stats
When the final build of the game comes out the base stats will be here

## Abilities
### Passives
Vandal has two passive abilities. These are a power slide and a double jump. <br />
#### Double Jump
While in mid-air press space again to jump higher. Doing this builds up heat (see movement basics for more info) <br />
~ Waiting for the game to check preservation of directional momentum
#### Power Slide
While sprinting press crouch, this will cause you to power slide and launch you in your movement direction with the cost of heat build up.

### Tactical
#### Arm Cannons (Need to check the name of this)
Vandal launches a projectile out of the arms. When this hits a surface and explodes it deals damage and knocks enemies away from the direction of explosion. <br />
Cooldown: 45s (?)
### Prime
#### Overclock (? need to check this name)
Gain increased agility (move speed) along with heat capacity or lowered heat build up. For a duration. <br />
Cooldown: 120s (?)

## Vandal Specific Cores
Waiting for bungie.



## Movement Basic Information
### Heat
When sprinting your character will gain heat. This heat build up is viewable on the hud as shown below. <br />
![/assets/heat-bar.png](/assets/heat-bar.png) <br />
When full this will go into a lockout period where any further heat build up will be blocked, as Vandal this locks out most of your movement options so keeping this down is key to survival in ambush situations.

### Heat Extras
When in rain (outside with the map raining) or standing/running in water heat build up is less (need to find out by how much) and has an icon below it to represent this. <br />

During these times Vandal is more powerful (obviously) so if the map is in rainy conditions aim to take fights outside to maximise ability usage.

## Vandal Specific Movement Options
### Fall Damage Negation
While falling and not in heat lock out vandals double jump is still able to be activated.  Since the double jump removes all downward momentum which allows a correctly timed jump input to negate all fall damage, this timing differs by ping but once you have the timing this is a very simple thing to do.

### As more things get discovered they will be added here, if you discover something please raise it in an issue and I will add it here with credit, if a tech is misattributed please also raise this in an issue.
