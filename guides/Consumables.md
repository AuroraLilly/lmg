Apart from [healing items](/guides/Heals.md) and [repair kits for os and mechanical failures](/guides/S&H.md) there are other utility consumables with different abilities.

## Cardio Kick
Increases agility (?) and/or decreases heat build up (?)

## Signal Jammer
Makes you unable to be pinged, hides you from thermal scopes, hides you from scans, blurs you and the area around you to outside observers.
