# Guides and Wikis
The stuff I write may not always be up to date nor the most accurate, however there are many other ways to find info! Below is a non excusive list of them. They are also in no particular order. Please look at the footnotes for extra info about these resources that you may wish to review.

### [CyberAcme - Marathon Companion](https://cyberacme.org/)

### [Marathon-Guide.com](https://marathon-guide.com/)

### [The Codex Compendium](https://marathonthegame.fandom.com/)

### [CyberAcme - Marathon Wiki](https://www.marathonwiki.com/)
A wiki covering the og games along with having some resources for the new games. [^3]


[^1]: There has been controversy surrounding this resource, the dev apparently leaked details of Triage's, and put peoples weapon reviews about NDA'd content through a LLM and published them under the reviewee's name. According to the developer Triage's details were removed quickly and the reviews were used as placeholders during the development with said content now removed leaving only AI generated placeholder reviews. 

[^2]: This site is hosted on Fandom which has had a lot of controversy in the past with desertions and advertising etc. If you are going to use this resource please use something like [UBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) on Firefox based browsers or [UBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh) on Chromium based browsers.

[^3]: At the moment I am unable to determine if this will be developed into the new game, I'm assuming it will be.
