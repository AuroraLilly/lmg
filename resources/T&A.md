# Tools and Applications
The following is a list of tools and applications to help you throughout your adventures on Tau Ceti IV. This list is in no particular order.

### [CyberAcme - Marathon Companion](https://cyberacme.org/)
A database with maps and guides for help on Tau Ceti IV.

### [Marathon-Guide.com](https://marathon-guide.com/)
Contains guides, info and stats about a lot of things Marathon. [^1]

### [Sovereign's Marathon Achievement Hunter](https://smah.bumgie.org/)
A fun resource made to track different unofficial achievements you could do.

### [Total Collapse](https://totalcollapse.org)
My homebrewed mapping app for marathon, made if you want a quick way to annotate maps, or put poi's on. [^2]


# Stay Away From These Ones
The following is a list of applications to use at your own risk. There will be full explanations as to why you should head this warning. If you do end up using these tools all the more power to you but **here be compilers**.




[^1]: There has been controversy surrounding this resource, the dev apparently leaked details of Triage, and put peoples weapon reviews about NDA'd content through a LLM and published them under the reviewee's name. According to the developer, Triage's details were removed quickly, and the reviews were used as placeholders during the development with said content now removed. This leaves only AI generated placeholder reviews. 

[^2]: AI was used in the creation of this. I regret this and at some point I will do a full code refactor and remove this but at the moment if you do not wish to support AI feel free not to use this :) - None of this resource/guide will ever use ai generated content.
