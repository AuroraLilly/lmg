# Tools and Applications
The following is a list of tools and applications to help you throughout your adventures on Tau Ceti IV. This list is in no particular order.

### [CyberAcme - Marathon Companion](https://cyberacme.org/)
A database with maps and guides for help on Tau Ceti IV.

### [Marathon-Guide.com](https://marathon-guide.com/)
Contains guides, info and stats about a lot of things Marathon. [^1]

### [Sovereign's Marathon Achievement Hunter](https://smah.bumgie.org/)
A fun resource made to track different unofficial achievements you could do.

### [Total Collapse](https://totalcollapse.org)
My homebrewed mapping app for marathon, made if you want a quick way to annotate maps, or put poi's on. [^2]


# Stay Away From These Ones
The following is a list of applications to use at your own risk. There will be full explanations as to why you should head this warning. If you do end up using these tools all the more power to you but **here be compilers**. 

### Runner - Marathon Map App
[Link](https://marathonmap.app/)
If you are not into AI definitely do not use this app as this app leans on AI heavily in its development chain. <br />
The developer of this app ran into controversy where they (as I interpret it) asked for permission to use an artists art and then put it through an AI model or modified it without permission of the artist, leading to the artist revoking permission to use the art. <br />
Furthermore this app is entered into the pump.fun hackathon where it has a crypto token ($RUNNER) it is not used in the app however any profits made from the app are redistributed to shareholders. <br />
Based on the developers previous applications this app may have either a payment to use it or a freemium/subscription service to access parts of the app. This would be in direct violation of the  [Bungies Content Usage Rules](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/legal/terms) and could lead to the app not being developed further or being taken down. <br />
In terms of where content is coming from I cannot say, I have heard that the app by the same developer used public wiki content in the app or resources from the wikis in the app possibly locking some behind a paywall, if this is true then this is just sad. 




[^1]: There has been controversy surrounding this resource, the dev apparently leaked details of Triage's, and put peoples weapon reviews about NDA'd content through a LLM and published them under the reviewee's name. According to the developer Triage's details were removed quickly and the reviews were used as placeholders during the development with said content now removed leaving only AI generated placeholder reviews. 

[^2]: AI was used in the creation of this. I regret this and at some point I will do a full code refactor and remove this but at the moment if you do not wish to support AI feel free not to use this :) - None of this resource/guide will ever use ai generated content.
