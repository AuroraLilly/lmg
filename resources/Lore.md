# Lore
I myself love the lore of Marathon, the writers have done a lovely job on it. If you wish to get more into the lore of the game the resources below should help you :)

## Websites
### [Karnemir's Lore Archive](https://marathon.karnemir.com/)
Contains lots of nice info that was discovered during the args while also having lore archives from the previous Marathon games.

### [Marathon's Story by Hamish Sinclair](https://marathon.bungie.org/story/)
A lovely long read that is still getting updated to this day. Was made in 1995! Go give it a read it contains a wealth of information.
